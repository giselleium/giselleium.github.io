    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <p class="subtext">
      A software engineer and content creator actively seeking roles in the
      dynamic realms of software development and gaming. My focus centers on
      contributing my expertise to the industry and spreading a positive message
      to my audience. I am currently in pursuit of the Unity Associate
      Certification in Game Development and Programming, and a certification in
      C#, to showcase my skillset and learn new tricks along the way.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      My experience as a software developer started in hybrid marketing roles
      where I worked with MarTech tools to create and manage events and
      campaigns for SaaS-Based companies. This eventually led to me taking up
      opportunities to host and create content surrounding game devolvement and
      the software engineering process.

      One of my prominent achievements encompasses the creation of a Unity VR
      interactive space meticulously designed to support mental health

      unique and fruitful ways to bring the knowledge I have of software
      development to those who made need it.

    <p class="subtext">
      As an additional pursuit, I am also a creator within the cosplay and
      gaming community and have hosted many events at conventions such as Los
      Angeles Comic Con. Through my web series pixels + progress and other
      content, I talk about inclusion, representation and the furtherment of
      knowledge while stressing the importance of diverse thinking within these
      spaces.
