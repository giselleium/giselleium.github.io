    <h1>SUMMARY</h1>
    <p class="subtext">
      A software engineer and content creator actively seeking roles in the
      dynamic realms of software development and gaming. My focus centers on
      contributing my expertise to the industry and spreading a positive message
      to my audience. I am currently in pursuit of the Unity Associate
      Certification in Game Development and Programming, and a certification in
      C#, to showcase my skillset and learn new tricks along the way.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      My experience as a software developer started in hybrid marketing roles
      where I worked with MarTech tools to create and manage events and
      campaigns for SaaS-Based companies. This eventually led to me taking up
      opportunities to host and create content surrounding game devolvement and
      the software engineering process.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      One of my prominent achievements encompasses the creation of a Unity VR
      interactive space meticulously designed to support mental health
      initiatives. Through the creations of projects such as these, I find
      unique and fruitful ways to bring the knowledge I have of software
      development to those who made need it.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      As an additional pursuit, I am also a creator within the cosplay and
      gaming community and have hosted many events at conventions such as Los
      Angeles Comic Con. Through my web series pixels + progress and other
      content, I talk about inclusion, representation and the furtherment of
      knowledge while stressing the importance of diverse thinking within these
      spaces.
